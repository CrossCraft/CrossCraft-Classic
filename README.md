CrossCraft-Classic is a project that aims to recreate Minecraft Java Edition: Classic without looking at any of the source code of the original application and without using the original copyrighted assets. All knowledge is figured out with an understanding of in-game mechanics and is approximated to be as close as possible to the original.

Textures are a combination of handmade and adaptations from [Unity Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/unity) under CC0

CrossCraft's goal is to be platform-independent and work across all PC platforms and many major game consoles. The original release of CrossCraft will include Windows, Linux, and PSP support. Further support will be added over time as systems change and upgrade.

## Version Compatibility

CrossCraft Classic is meant to replicate the functionality of Minecraft Classic v0.30. It contains all the blocks from that version and is meant to represent the creative mode of the game. CrossCraft does not support saves yet, though that is a work-in-progress. 

Currently, CrossCraft Classic does not support multiplayer, though there is a work-in-progress effort to make a CrossCraft Classic Server and add client functionality into CrossCraft Classic.

Classic's survival mode will be made into a separate project called CrossCraft Survival Test.
