CrossCraft Classic uses assets both derived and used 
from the Unity, the Pixel Perfection Community Edition,
and the "defaultish" resource packs.

Defaultish was used to provide the ascii font file
default.png.

Pixel Perfection Community Edition was used to provide
the block destroy states from terrain.png, as well as
the entirety of particles.png and particles.png.

Textures not explicitly referenced above have derived
from Unity.
